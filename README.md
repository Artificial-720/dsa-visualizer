# Data Structure and Algorithm Visualizer

This project, developed with Python and Tkinter, is designed to aid in visualizing and understanding data structures and algorithms.

## Features

- **GUI**: Simple GUI to interact with data structures and algorithms.
- **Real-Time Visualization**: Watch algorithms like sorting, searching and others as they work.
- **Speed Control**: Adjustable speed settings to control how quickly each algorithm visualizes its steps.

## Installation

To get started, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Artificial-720/dsa-visualizer.git
   cd dsa-visualizer
   ```

2. **Install Requirements**:
   Ensure you have Python 3 installed. You can install the required libraries with:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Visualizer**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Supported Data Structures

- **Array**
- **Stack**
- **Queue**
- **Linked List**
- **Tree** (Binary, AVL, etc.)
- **Graph** (with BFS, DFS, and other traversal algorithms)

## Supported Algorithms
