# Data Structure and Algorithm Visualizer

This project, developed with Python and Tkinter, is designed to aid in visualizing and understanding data structures and algorithms.

## Features

- **GUI**: Simple GUI to interact with data structures and algorithms.
- **Real-Time Visualization**: Watch algorithms like sorting, searching and others as they work.
- **Speed Control**: Adjustable speed settings to control how quickly each algorithm visualizes its steps.

## Installation

To get started, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Artificial-720/dsa-visualizer.git
   cd dsa-visualizer
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure Python is installed and Tkinter is available on your system. You may need to install Tkinter:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install python3-tk
    ```

3. **Run the Visualizer**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
